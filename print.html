<p>Hi, I am <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@justenoughalgorithms">JustEnoughAlgorithms</a> and I'm working on this because I want to get more people to use this method. This book is heavily inspired by the <a href="https://zzmethod.com">zzmethod.com</a> website by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@crystalcuber">crystalcuber</a>.
The purpose of this book is to be a learning resource for all levels of APB users, as well as to showcase this method to users of other methods like CFOP, Roux or ZZ. I've been maining this method since autumn of 2023 and have since beaten all of my old PBs that I set with Roux.
This book is written using the rust-based <a href="https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook">mdBook</a>-utility.</p>

<image class="right" alt='Symbolic image of the APB method' src="/images/apb-icon.png">
<p>APB was originally developed by James Straughon aka. Athefre. It stands for Athefre's Pair and Block.</p>
<h2 id="steps"><a class="header" href="#steps">Steps</a></h2>
<p>Standard APB consists of 5 steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="tutorial/223.html"><strong>2x2x3</strong></a>: Solve a 2x2x3 block in the bottom-left. This is usually accomplished by building a Roux-style 1x2x3 block and then extending it by solving the DF and DB edges.</li>
<li><a href="tutorial/pair.html"><strong>dBR Pair</strong></a>: The back-right F2L pair is solved intuitively.</li>
<li><a href="tutorial/eo.html"><strong>EO</strong></a>: The edge-orientation of the remaining edges is solved algorithmically (11 algorithms).</li>
<li><a href="tutorial/lxs.html"><strong>LXS</strong></a>: The remaining three F2L pieces are solved algorithmically (116 algorithms).</li>
<li><a href="tutorial/zbll.html"><strong>ZBLL</strong></a>: The last layer is solved (493 algorithms).</li>
</ol>
<p>This resolves to a hefty number of 620 algorithms. This number can be reduced to 39, by solving LXS intuitively (for which you do need to know the 20 F2L last slot cases) and using OCLL + PLL for the last layer.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="apb-tutorial"><a class="header" href="#apb-tutorial">APB Tutorial</a></h1>
<p>This section will teach you how to use APB in speedsolves. For the purpose of easier explaining, the tutorial will be given with white as the bottom color, even though it is strongly recommended to be able to use white and yellow as your bottom color (x2y color neutrality). This tutorial (and this method as a whole) is not intended for people wanting to learn how to solve the Rubik's cube.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="2x2x3"><a class="header" href="#2x2x3">2x2x3</a></h1>
<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube with the 2x2x3 block on the bottom-left completed" src="/images/tutorial/223/223.png">
<p>The first step of APB is the creation of a 2x2x3 block in the bottom-left. This can be approached in multiple different ways, although creating a Roux-style 1x2x3-block and then extending it is the best option most of the time.</p>
<h2 id="ways-of-creating-the-2x2x3"><a class="header" href="#ways-of-creating-the-2x2x3">Ways of Creating the 2x2x3:</a></h2>
<h3 id="1x2x3--2x2x3"><a class="header" href="#1x2x3--2x2x3"><a href="tutorial//tutorial/223/123-223.html">1x2x3 â†’ 2x2x3</a></a></h3>
<p>This is the preferred and on most scrambles the most efficient way to create the 2x2x3. You first create a Roux-style 1x2x3 block and then solve the remaining two edges.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create the 1x2x3:</strong> This can be done by connecting a white edge to its other colored center, then the two adjacent F2L-pairs can be solved. Note, that the block has to be made on the left side and you should not use any cube rotations during the whole solve, so you have to take advantage of wide r moves to build your F2L-pairs. Obviously, there are different ways of building a 2x2x3 block, but that can be explored in Roux tutorials.</li>
<li><strong>Extend to a 2x2x3:</strong> At a beginner level, you should first match the centers in the M slice to the 1x2x3 block and then bring one of the two dM edges into the top layer. Depending on its orientation, it can be inserted with <code>r U2 r'</code> / <code>r' U2 r</code> or <code>r U' r'</code> / <code>r' U r</code>. At higher levels, this step is often done by solving the dM edges in relation to each other and then joining them with the white center using M moves.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="2x2x2--2x2x3"><a class="header" href="#2x2x2--2x2x3">2x2x2 â†’ 2x2x3</a></h3>
<p>This way can be really efficient if the scramble is good. During the whole process, make sure not to rotate.</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Create 1x2x2 square:</strong> Either you create a center-edge-corner-edge square, or you create a center-edge-center square,</li>
<li><strong>Join another 1x2x2 square:</strong> You have to join one of the other type (if you made a CECE square first, you now have to join a CEC square)</li>
<li><strong>Join yet another 1x2x2 square:</strong> This square needs to be a Center-Edge-Corner-Edge square.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="three-cross-edges--two-f2l-pairs"><a class="header" href="#three-cross-edges--two-f2l-pairs">Three Cross Edges + Two F2L pairs</a></h3>
<div class="warning"><b>Note:</b><br>This method should only be used if the scramble allows for an efficient solution with it. Do not solve the 2x2x3 like this by default.</div>
<ol>
<li><strong>Solve three cross pieces:</strong> Solve the cross like you do with CFOP, but you leave out one of the edges. Ideally, you should orient the edges of the two F2L-pairs that you're going to solve in the next step at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Solve two F2L pairs:</strong> Solve the two left F2L pairs rotationless.</li>
</ol>

<p>The most common way of creating a 2x2x3 block at the start of the solve is by creating a Roux-style 1x2x3 block on the left side and then adding the DF and DB edges.</p>
<h2 id="1-solve-the-1x2x3"><a class="header" href="#1-solve-the-1x2x3">1. Solve the 1x2x3</a></h2>
<p>Since this step is identical to the first block of the Roux method, there is already a lot of information about it on the internet. I'd recommend these two videos by Kian Mansour. Alternatively you can read the guide below, although the videos are better for beginners.</p>

<h2 id="ways-of-solving-the-1x2x3"><a class="header" href="#ways-of-solving-the-1x2x3">Ways of solving the 1x2x3</a></h2>
<p>This list is not meant as a step-by-step explanation, it should give you some ideas about how you can create a 1x2x3 on your own.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>White edge + two F2L pairs:</strong> First you solve the white edge to its non-white center. Then you create the two adjacent F2L pairs and join everything together.</li>
<li><strong>1x2x2 â†’ 1x2x3:</strong> You create a 1x2x2 block by building two 1x1x2 lines and joining them. Then you add the remaining F2L pair.</li>
<li><strong>Line + Line:</strong> You create a corner-edge-corner line and join it with an edge-center-edge line.</li>
<li><strong>Pseudoslotting:</strong> It is possible, even with APB, to build pseudo pairs to solve your 1x2x3. Keep in mind that it is impractical to keep the D layer misaligned further than the dBR pair creation though.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="ways-of-solving-dfdb-edges"><a class="header" href="#ways-of-solving-dfdb-edges">Ways of solving DFDB edges</a></h2>
<p>This video by Greg Cannon showcases different ways of solving the DF and DB edges.</p>
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ai3qnnFBNuI?si=tGO771FYvDL5FjIn" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>There are two main ways of solving the DF and DB edges:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Solve edges to centers separately:</strong> You solve the centers relative to your 1x2x3 block. Then you put one of your edges into the U layer. You can now insert it with <code>r U2 r'</code> / <code>r' U2 r</code> or <code>r U' r'</code> / <code>r' U r</code>, depending on the orientation of the edge. Repeat that with the second edge.</li>
<li><strong>Solve edges in relation to each other, then connect them with centers:</strong> You first put both edges opposite of each other with the white face facing up using the rRU moveset. Then you put the center between those edges using M moves. Finally, you can align the edges to their corresponding colored centers and bring them down using r moves.</li>

<p>The second step of APB is the creation and insertion of the back-right F2L pair.</p>
<h2 id="creating-the-pair"><a class="header" href="#creating-the-pair">Creating the pair</a></h2>
<p>Creating a pair is always possible using only <code>R</code> and <code>U</code> moves and no rotations (although sometimes there are better solutions with <code>F</code> moves). If you are unsure about how to solve a case, try putting the edge into the U layer and the corner in DFR or DFB so that the white sticker is on the right side. Then you can put the edge into UF or UB and then join it with the corner using R moves. <br></p>
<h2 id="inserting-the-pair"><a class="header" href="#inserting-the-pair">Inserting the pair</a></h2>
<p>If the pair is oriented, you can just insert it using R and U moves. If it is misoriented however, you should put the pair on the right and insert it with <code>f R' f'</code>.</p>
<h2 id="algorithmic-solutions"><a class="header" href="#algorithmic-solutions">Algorithmic solutions</a></h2>
<p>At a higher level, this step can be done algorithmically. The algorithms can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1U1nwq_-HLeDgajuAOVRaH2Jo7X9zSTEBrnIRSv3hzeg">Liam Highducheck's sheet</a>. It is recommended to at least take a look at the harder cases when you feel like your solution is long. This is especially the case for cases with a misoriented edge, as there are often fast algorithmic solutions using the S slice. However, it's not worth it to learn all of the 89 algorithms, as it is also important to be able to come up with solutions yourself and it's smarter to use your time otherwise.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="eo"><a class="header" href="#eo">EO</a></h1>
<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube with the EO step completed" src="/images/tutorial/eo/eo.png">
Edge orientation is the hardest concept in APB. In the EO step of APB, you orient the remaining six edges, that haven't been solved yet. If you already know what EO is, you can skip to [How to solve EO in APB](#how-to-solve-eo-in-apb).
## What is edge orientation?
[zzmethod.com](https://www.zzmethod.com/) already made a great video explaining edge orientation in the context of ZZ, if you only want to know about EO in general, you only have to watch until 7:42 minutes. Alternatively you can read the written tutorial below.
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fxwVmTI5nGM?si=-Q63PMa-NS9tqTja&amp;start=13" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>The orientation is a property of each edge on the cube. An edge can either be <em>good</em> or <em>bad</em>. An edge is good, if it can be solved with R, U, L, D and B moves. An edge is bad, if F or B moves are required to solve it.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-recognize-if-an-edge-is-good-or-bad"><a class="header" href="#how-to-recognize-if-an-edge-is-good-or-bad">How to recognize if an edge is good or bad</a></h2>
<p>You can recognize the orientation of an edge by looking at its colors. If the edge has white or yellow on it (or the top/bottom color respectively), the white face must be:</p>
<ul>
<li>on the top or bottom for U and D layer edges</li>
<li>on front or at the back for the E layer edges</li>
</ul>
<p>for the edge to be considered <em>good</em>.
If the edge doesn't have white or yellow on it, the front/back color takes the role of white or yellow respectively.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-solve-eo-in-apb"><a class="header" href="#how-to-solve-eo-in-apb">How to solve EO in APB</a></h2>
<div class="warning"><b>Note:</b><br>In the beginnings of APB, the pair was created and then left where it happened to be. It was then inserted while doing edge orientation in the next step. To learn more about this, see <a href="tutorial//variations/eopair.html">EOPair</a>. This way of doing the pair and edge orientation was disbanded, because it only saved 0.3 moves on average, but required 117 more algorithms.</div>
<h3 id="recognition"><a class="header" href="#recognition">Recognition</a></h3>
<p>In the EO step, six edges have to be oriented. Five of them have white or yellow on them, so the recognition is no problem. The sixth edge, belonging into FR, should be tracked during pair creation. Make sure not to look at the back or left face of the UL and UB edges respectively. Since you have already tracked edge belonging into FR, if the top color is not white/yellow, the edge is misoriented (except if the edge belonging into FR is in one of these places of course).</p>
<h3 id="orienting-the-edges"><a class="header" href="#orienting-the-edges">Orienting the edges</a></h3>
<p>In APB, the edges are oriented algorithmically. These algorithms can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hs9ikHz-4cfbqBfqvuvE8X9sjCb4Jtm482ZvsFQA2rY/">EOpair sheet</a>. Note that this sheet is not fully up do date and thus still includes all the 128 EOPair algorithms. You only need to learn the algorithms in the "dBR Solved EO" tab.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="lxs"><a class="header" href="#lxs">LXS</a></h1>
<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube with the EO step completed" src="/images/tutorial/lxs/lxs.png">
<p>LXS stands for Last eXtended Slot and it is the best step of the APB method. During this step, you solve the remaining three pieces in the first two layers algorithmically. LXS is extremely fast and the recognition is super easy. Even though there are 116 algorithms, they are really easy to learn and many achieve to learn them within a few days. The algorithms can be found in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/">Athefre's sheet</a>.</p>
<h2 id="beginner-approach-to-lxs"><a class="header" href="#beginner-approach-to-lxs">Beginner Approach to LXS</a></h2>
<p>If you haven't learned all of the LXS algorithms yet, you can solve these three pieces according to the following method:</p>
<ol>
<li>Solve the DR edge by either putting it in UL and then doing <code>S R2 S' R2</code> or, if the edge is in FR, by doing <code>R' U' R' U R</code>.</li>
<li>Solve the remaining F2L pair intuitively or by using the <em>DR edge at DR</em> algorithms in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1P2DB0SyA1BrezYJ_g7RJ7_l32Ilxq7lLtr53zlG_TUU/">Athefre's LXS sheet</a>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Do keep in mind that your goal should be to learn all of the 116 LXS algorithms. If you don't want to learn this many algorithms, use Roux or CFOP.</p>
<h2 id="learning-lxs"><a class="header" href="#learning-lxs">Learning LXS</a></h2>
<p>LXS is much easier than you might expect. Contrary to algorithm sets like OLL, PLL or ZBLL, most of the algorithms are quite intuitive. Nevertheless, LXS should be solved algorithmically for better efficiency and turning speed.<br>
You should start with the cases where the corner is in the D layer (DFR, RDF, FRD). With these 26 algorithms (including 5 F2L cases) you can solve every LXS case with two steps:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Insert Corner:</strong> Insert the DFR corner using <code>R U R'</code> or <code>R U' R'</code>.</li>
<li><strong>Solve LXS case:</strong> Solve the resulting LXS case.</li>
</ol>
<p>This should make you more familiar with the LXS step.<br>
For easier learning, you can use <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ACKQXpMK0b8RWGoN9wMDbnF-W-S4mMdeJH5IcjeEyf8/">Liam Highducheck's LXS patterns sheet</a>, which assigns each case to one of six groups.</p>

<h2 id="how-far-should-i-inspect"><a class="header" href="#how-far-should-i-inspect">How far should I inspect?</a></h2>
<p>At an intermediate level, you should be able to inspect the 1x2x3. As you get quicker, you should start looking for the DFDB edges and try to predict where they are after you create the 1x2x3. Eventually you should inspect solving the whole 2x2x3 and maybe even the pair or the rough position of its pieces.</p>
<h2 id="how-can-i-train-inspection"><a class="header" href="#how-can-i-train-inspection">How can I train inspection?</a></h2>
<p>Just inspect one step/sub-step more than you are comfortable with in speedsolves, no matter how long it takes you. It is okay if you take multiple minutes to inspect the 1x2x3 at the start, you will only improve at inspection if you train inspecting more a lot.</p>
<h2 id="executing-the-inspected-moves"><a class="header" href="#executing-the-inspected-moves">Executing the inspected moves</a></h2>
<p>After you've started the solve, try executing the inspected moves as fast as possible.

You might want to slow down a little in order to track the pieces for the next step, but with training, you won't have to decrease your turning speed that much for that.</p>

<p>These are variations/extensions for the APB method. Keep in mind that you should focus on learning standard APB before you start learning them.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="eopair"><a class="header" href="#eopair">EOPair</a></h1>
<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube before the EOPair step was completed." src="/images/variations/eopair/eopair.png">
<p>EOPair is an algorithm set for solving edge orientation while inserting the dBR pair. This was the standard way of doing APB, until it was replaced by solving the pair completely and then doing edge orientation in early 2024. The reasons for this change where the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Algorithm Count:</strong> EOPair had 128 algorithms while pair followed by EO only requires 11 algorithms.</li>
<li><strong>Not much less Efficient:</strong> Inserting the pair and then solving EO only averages about 0.3 moves worse.</li>
<li><strong>EOPair recognition:</strong> Due to needing to check the BR edge for EOPair recognition, quick recognition is quite difficult. With pair + EO, the BR spot is already occupied with the pair, so the recognition is much faster.</li>
</ul>
<p>Still, there is an argument about the utility of the misoriented U subset. Since the pair has to be inserted into dBR no matter its orientation in standard APB, a misoriented pair requires three moves to be inserted, that could be used to orient some edges.<br>
The algorithms can be found in the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Hs9ikHz-4cfbqBfqvuvE8X9sjCb4Jtm482ZvsFQA2rY/">EOPair sheet</a>.</p>

<image class="right" alt="Rubik's Cube with the EO step completed but with dFR pair instead of dBR pair" src="/images/variations/dfr/dfr.png">
<p>After having completed the 2x2x3 block, you can opt to solve the dFR pair instead of the dBR pair. Generally, you should not do this due to the more difficult recognition for the following EO and LXS steps. Having the dBR slot occupied eliminates a blind spot. Therefore you should really only use dFR pair if it is already solved or a really easy case and you already have recognised it. Don't pause to check if the dFR pair is better, only do it when you recognise it during 2x2x3.</p>
<h2 id="algorithms-1"><a class="header" href="#algorithms-1">Algorithms</a></h2>
<p>For dFR pair, you obviously need to use different algorithms for LXS and EO. Most of the cases are just the mirrored version of the dBR pair algorithms.</p>

<p>The NPB / APBig method was developed by V Sundararajan. The steps are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Solve two centers:</strong> Solve two centers that are opposite of each other. They will be your U/D colors eventually, so you should probably pick white and yellow, unless you are fully color neutral. Put the centers at U &amp; D.</li>
<li><strong>Solve two adjacent cross edges:</strong> Pair two adjacent cross edges and join them to their center. Remember to put them in the right order. Hold the incomplete cross on the bottom</li>
<li><strong>Solve remaining centers:</strong> Hold the partial cross on the L face at BL and DL, then solve the remaining centers using R, U and F moves.</li>
<li><strong>Create a 2x2x2 block:</strong> Hold the cross on the bottom with the edges at DL and DB, then pair the required F2L edge using u and d moves. When it's paired, put it into the U layer and fix the centers. Finally, insert the edge with its corner into dBL</li>
<li><strong>Pair FL and FD edges:</strong> Pair the FL and FD edges edge using u and d moves, put them into the U layer and restore the centers</li>
<li><strong>Solve the 2x2x3 block:</strong> Solve the 2x2x3 block using the edges you paired in the previous step.</li>
<li><strong>Pair remaining edges:</strong> Do a <code>y</code> rotation and pair the remaining edges like the 2-3 part in 3-2-3 edge pairing. For this you should use the RUuLF moveset.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the dBR pair:</strong> Do a <code>y'</code> rotation and continue the solve with the dBR pair.</li>
<li><strong>OLL parity:</strong> Check during EO recognition if you have OLL parity and correct it immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the cube:</strong> Solve the cube normally and do PLL parity at the end / before ZBLL if required.</li>

<p>The Meyer method was originally developed for the Roux method, but since both Roux and APB (usually) start with a 1x2x3 block, this method works just as well with APB. A video explanation by Kian Mansour is below but note this small difference: At 8:38 minutes, Kian specifically creates the edge belonging into DR. With APB you either just make any edge, or the one belonging into DB for easier look-ahead into 3x3 stage. Alternatively, you can read the text explanation below.</p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Solve two centers:</strong> Solve two centers that are opposite of each other. They will be your L/R colors eventually, so if you're x2y color neutral, you can pick any color except for white and yellow.</li>
<li><strong>Create a 1x2x3 block on the left:</strong> Hold the two centers on L &amp; R. Create a 1x2x3 block on the left side of the cube, as if it was a 3x3. For that, you can all moves except for moves that turn the two equator slices.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the remaining centers:</strong> Solve the remaining four centers while respecting their correct order. For that you can use the RrUl moveset.</li>
<li><strong>Pair the edges:</strong> Hold the 1x2x3 on the bottom in the back. Then, pair the edge that will eventually belong into DB and place it into FD. Then you can restore the centers. Now you can use any method of pairing up the edges. For 4x4, I'd recommend 3-2-3 edge pairing while for all bigger cubes you should use Freeslice.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the DF and DB edges:</strong> Hold the 1x2x3 on the left at the bottom again and solve the DF and DB edges normally.</li>
<li><strong>Solve the dBR pair:</strong> Solve the dBR pair.</li>
